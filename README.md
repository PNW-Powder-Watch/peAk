### Target Demographic:
Snowboarders and skiers who want to consolidate their trip planning and intragroup communcation.

### Preliminary Vision:
The app that we plan to develop will be a mobile version of the web application that we rolled out at the beginning of 2019. Within peAk, app users will have the ability to host ski / snowboard meetups from an assortment of ski resorts saved to our databse. Each ski resort saved to our system will display weather reports, snofall levels, and a map to provide users with a visual reference of the resort. With our mobile iteration of this app, we intend give users the abilty to also search mountain resorts and add new destinations to our database so that app users nationwide can connect in different regions. Additionally, peAk will allow users to chat with one another across their android devices, both by posting in group chat portals and by sending direct messages to one another to coordinate last minute meetup details. peAk will also feature user profiles for each user. We envision users uplaoding profile pictures to the app so that other skiers and snowboarders can recognize them on the slopes. These profiles will be visible to other users on group detail pages for reference. Overall, we envision peAk being an application that will allow users to connect, plan ski / snowboard trips at specific resorts, and coordinate meetup logistics in real time.
