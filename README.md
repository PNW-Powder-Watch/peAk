### Target Demographic:
Snowboarders and skiers who want to consolidate their trip planning and intra group communication to one place.

### Overview:
peAK is an Android application developed to facilitate snowboard  / ski meetups at alpine resorts on 
the West Coast of the United States. Within peAk, users can browse through a small collection of 
resorts served by our custom python API. Within each resort page, app users can also browse meetups 
posted to that specific resort. Trip details can be viewed after clicking on meetups stored in the 
recycler views of each resort detail page. peAk users can also establish their own meetups by filling 
out a form and creating a new meetup post at a specific resort. <br/>

To date, our team was only able to develop the aforementioned features. In subsequent iterations of 
our project, we envision users having the essential capabilities to 1) signup and login, 2) to post 
new meetups to any resort stored in our database (currently, we have only established the logic to 
post meetups to Badger Mountain via form submission), 3) to join groups created by other app users, 
4) to post messages to a group message board to coordinate trip logistics, and 5) to view one's 
collection of future trips in a My Groups page.
